# Artificial-Intelligence-Challenge2

We will make a union design to keep the picture out of the RNN/LSTM and consequently have the option to prepare the piece of the neural organization that handles pictures and the part that handles language independently, utilizing pictures and sentences from isolated preparing sets. </br >
To encode our picture highlights we will utilize move learning. There are a ton of models that we can utilize like VGG-16, InceptionV3, ResNet, and so forth
We will utilize the inceptionV3 model which has the most un-number of preparing boundaries in contrast with the others and furthermore beats them.
